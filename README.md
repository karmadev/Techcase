# The CASE
Your assignment is to create a web application that displays all items and all locations. It's should be easy and clear to see which items belong to which location. It should be possible to filter on locations and ingredients. It should also be possible to sort by name, price and location. 

You are free to setup the project in any way you see fit but the requirements are as follows:

* Use React and Redux
* Use a modern version of JavaScript (ECMAScript 6 at least, but later is good too)
* Add docs so we know how to run the example
* Add comments whenever you're making an assumption 

Put the code in a git repo and send us a mail with a link to the repo or the repo tar ball when you're done, there is no deadline but the sooner the better.
You are allowed to make assumptions whenever there's something unclear - how you deal with those are also part of this challenge. ;)
